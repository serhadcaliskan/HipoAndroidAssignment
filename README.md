# HipoAndroidAssignment

A simple app taking a given json file on Github and presenting it with a recylerview.
There are also add member and search member functionalities.

I used *MVVM* design pattern.

### Libraries that I used

  * **Retrofit** to get data from Github file like an API call. 
  * **Coroutines** to fetch data asynchronously.
  * **Hilt** for dependency injection.
  * **Material Design** components which are TextField and FloatingActionButton.
